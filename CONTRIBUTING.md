# Contributing
Here a few things you can do to help 19XX.

## Play and Share
Sit down and enjoy some games. If you like 19XX, recommend it to a friend, encourage your local TO to use 19XX at tournaments, etc.

## Report Bugs
Submit bug reports here or contact me on Twitter (@cyjorg). When reporting a bug, make sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug and include the behavior you expected as well as the behavior you observed.

## Give Feedback
Tell me what you want to see out of the next rendition of 19XX. I am very open to ideas on features and improvements. Again, you can contact me on Twitter (@cyjorg).

## Program Yourself
If youâ€™d like to implement a feature, start your own fork. I will review code myself to ensure that the features added quality improvements. If so, they will be merged into the master branch. Code that does not follow the style [described here](https://github.com/jordanbarkley/19XX/blob/master/STYLE.md) will be rejected.
